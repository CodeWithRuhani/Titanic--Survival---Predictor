# Titanic--Survival --Predictor
 A machine learning model to predict Titanic passanger Survival. This project is basically a web application built using Python and Streamlit to predict whether a Titanic passanger would have survived based on input features like gender , age and whether the person was alone.
 # Technologies Used 
 -Python
 -Pandas
 -Streamlit
 -Scikit-learn
 -Logistic Regression
 # How it works
 - User selects gender,age and alone status.
 - Model predicts the survival outcome using a trained logistic regression model.
 -Displays the result directly on the browser using Streamlit.
